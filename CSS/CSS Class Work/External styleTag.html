         A delightful and humorous tale about a chicken who learns to speak as we do. What follows will intrigue young children and, at the same time, alert them in a very amusing way to the dangers of being too gullible. This is illustrator/animator Jeff Jackson’s first children’s book. It expresses his unique ability to create a lively and amusing world, rich in color and in which anything can happen.
