        WhatsApp (officially WhatsApp Messenger), owned by Meta Platforms, is an American social media, instant messaging (IM), and Voice over IP (VoIP) service accessible via desktop and mobile app.[13][14] It allows users to send text messages, voice messages, and video messages,[15] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content.[16][17] The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to register.[18] WhatsApp was launched in February 2009. In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client.[19][20] As of May 2025, the service had 3 billion monthly active users, making it the most used messenger app.[21] The name of the app is meant to sound like "what's up".
