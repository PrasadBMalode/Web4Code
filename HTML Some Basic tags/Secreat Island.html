        <h1>The secreat island</h1>
        <p>
         North Sentinel lies 36 km (22 mi) west of the village of Wandoor in South Andaman Island,[2] 50 km (25 nmi) west of Port Blair,
         and 60 km (30 nmi) north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island. 
         It has an area of about 59.67 km2 (23.04 sq mi) and a roughly square outline.
         [3]North Sentinel is surrounded by coral reefs, and lacks natural harbours. The entire island, other than the shore, is forested.[36] There is a narrow, white-sand beach encircling the island,
         behind which the ground rises 20 metres (66 ft), 
         and then gradually to between 46 and 122 metres (151 and 400 ft)[1][37]: 257  near the centre.
         Reefs extend around the island to between 0.9 and 1.5 km (0.5–0.8 nmi) from the shore.[1] A forested islet, 
         Constance Island, also "Constance Islet",[1] was located about 600 metres (2,000 ft) off the southeast coastline, at the edge of the reef.
         The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tilted the tectonic plate under the island, lifting it by one to two metres (3 to 7 ft).
         Large tracts of the surrounding coral reefs were exposed and became permanently dry land or shallow lagoons,
         extending all the island's boundaries – by as much as one kilometre (3,300 ft) on the west and south sides – and uniting Constance Islet with the main island.</p>
