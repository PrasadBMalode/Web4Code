        <h2>The Mysterious Island Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            It was a <b>stormy night</b> when Captain Mira and her crew stumbled upon a <u>hidden island</u>
            in the Pacific. According to <i>ancient legends</i>, this island only appears once every <mark>100 years</mark>. 
            Mira, fascinated by the myth, recalled an old manuscript found in the library of Atlantis<sub>2</sub>, which referenced an energy crystal that could bend time<sup>3</sup>. 
            As they explored, they found a strange device inscribed with coordinates and a note: <a href="Secreat Is">"Unlock the truth within."</a> The device pulsed with a faint glow,
            hinting that the <i><b>legend was real</b></i>.
